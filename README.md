# excel_crowdfunding_analysis
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organisations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this project, I will organise and analyse a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends
# instruction
1.highlight  "outcome" column with a different colour, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, cancelled, or is currently live.

2.Create a new column called "Percent Funded" that uses a formula to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.

  highlight "Percent Funded" column according to a three-colour scale. The scale should start at 0 with a dark shade of red, and it should transition to green at 100 and blue at 200.
3.Create a new column called "Average Donation" that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.

  Create two new columns, one called "Parent Category" and another called "Sub-Category", that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns.
  
4.Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyses initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, cancelled, or are currently live per category.

  Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table that you created.
  
5.Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyses initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or cancelled, or are currently live per sub-category.

  Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category based on the table that you created.
  
6.convert timestamps to a normal date.

  Create a new column named "Date Created Conversion" to convert the data contained in launched_at into Excel's date format.
  
  Create a new column named "Date Ended Conversion" to convert the data contained in deadline into Excel's date format.
  
  Create a new sheet with a pivot table that has a column of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcome, and filters based on parent category and Years.
  
  create a pivot-chart line graph that visualises this new table.
